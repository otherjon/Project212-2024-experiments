    This class represents a subsystem of individually addressable LEDs.

    The following terms are all equivalent:
     * addressable LED strip
     * individually addressable LED strip
     * 5-volt LED strip
     * three-wire LED strip
     * different LEDs can be set to different colors at the same time

    THE OPPOSITE can be described with the following equivalent terms:
     * 12-volt LED strip
     * four-wire LED strip
     * LED strip that *requires* a Blinkin-style controller
     * all LEDs must be the same color (which can change, but all LEDs change)
